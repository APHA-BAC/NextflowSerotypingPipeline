1) Installing and running Nextflow:
- create a new directory (e.g. called nextflow) in your /home directory (e.g. /home/jaromirguzinski/nextflow)
- cd into /nextflow and follow the instructions here https://www.nextflow.io/ (Nextflow homepage)
- copy the command curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash from the Nextflow homepage and paste it into the terminal
- the script should only need less than a minute to run, and when finished a shell script file called nextflow will appear in the /nextflow directory
- test if the Nextflow installation has completed without any errors by pasting the ./nextflow run hello command into the terminal

- it is recommended to keep the Nextflow script files (extension .nf) in the same directory as the nextflow shell script
- thus if the Nextflow script file is called pipeline.nf, this can be launched from the /home/jaromirguzinski/nextflow directory using the ./nextflow run pipeline.nf command
- after launching the Nextflow script, a new directory called work will appear in /home/jaromirguzinski/nextflow
- work will be continously updated while the Nextflow script is running and some output files as well as temporary files will be saved there

2) Installing pipeline component software


3) Instructions for running the Nextflow serotyping pipeline in SCEv2



4) Instructions for running the Nextflow serotyping pipeline in SCEv3
- the assumption is that the R1 and R2 fastq files for all of the isolates to be serotyped will be stored during the pipeline run on an external hard disk that will be mounted onto a directory called /disk
- thus the path to access the external hard disk should be /home/jaromirguzinski/disk - where jaromirguzinski is replaced by $USER
- 


- after entering into /disk, two directories need to be created there
- the WGS_Data directory will contain the R1 and R2 sequence files

- additionally, in /WGS_Data directory each time a new directory will need to be created, named for example after the sequencing run name: /home/$USER/disk/WGS_Data/run_n900  


- the WGS_Results is a directory where the serotyping pipeline output files will be written out to: /home/$USER/disk/WGS_Results


- summary.py scipt update the path with disk
- pipeline_disk.nf
- use WGS_Data and run name as inputs and WGS_Results as output names
- need to create these directories
